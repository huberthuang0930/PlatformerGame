# This is a platformer game with a heavenly and hellish twist. 
In this game, you start in the default level or "humanity level." You have 3 tries in this level. 
If you spend all 3 of your lives in the first level, you will proceed to die and go to the next level, which is "level hell." Level hell has a higher gravity and you also have 3 lives to try in level hell. If you use up all 3 lives in level hell, you will truly die.
On the other hand, if you survive level humanity or finish level hell, you will arrive at level "heaven." In level Heaven you also have 3 lives and if you die you go back to level Hell.
In order to beat the game, you have to complete level hell without dying in level Heaven.
Good luck!
